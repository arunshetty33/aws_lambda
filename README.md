# aws_lambda

# volume_list.py
This script will list all aws detached volumes and will send email using sns.

# aws_instance_schedule.py

This script queries running resources for a specific tag; the tag controls when resources should be switched on or off. Control over this tag can be handed to the resource owner, thereby providing a very simple method to govern the on/off schedule of a resource based on a weekly cycle.

# aws_auto_tagging.py

This code will tag aws EC2 instances automatically as per company standard.
